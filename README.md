# Predictive-Modeling-for-Housing-Prices-Using-Decision-Trees-and-Ensemble-Methods
1. Engineered predictive models using single decision tree and ensemble methods (Random Forest, Boosting) to forecast housing prices in Boston, MA.
2. Conducted comprehensive data preprocessing, categorization, and partitioning, creating robust training and testing datasets with caret.
3. Developed and evaluated regression models with rpart, randomForest, and xgboost, achieving enhanced performance metrics with Random Forest (RMSE: 3.13, MAE: 2.14).
4. Analyzed variable importance to identify key predictors, employing advanced statistical techniques for model optimization and accuracy improvement.
5. Summarized and analyzed the comparative performance of single and ensemble tree models, demonstrating the superiority of Random Forests in reducing prediction error.
