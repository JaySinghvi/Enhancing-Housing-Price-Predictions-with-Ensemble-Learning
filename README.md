This project leveraged machine learning to predict housing prices in Boston, employing Decision Trees, Random Forest, and Boosting methods. Extensive data preprocessing, categorization, and partitioning were performed to build reliable training datasets. The regression models, developed using rpart, randomForest, and xgboost, were rigorously evaluated, with Random Forest achieving the best performance (RMSE: 3.13, MAE: 2.14). A comparative analysis of single and ensemble models highlighted the effectiveness of feature importance analysis, confirming that Random Forest significantly reduced prediction errors and delivered more accurate price estimates.
